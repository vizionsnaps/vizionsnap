                            When COVID-19 sent our world into a frenzy, I got stuck at home with nothing to do. I knew that I didn't want to end my summer with nothing accomplished, 
                            so I set out a series of goals which I hope to accomplish by the end of the summer. After many nights of coding and head banging, here we are four months later. 
                            If you are reading this, then this means that I've accomplished one of my goals (Hint: It's to build a wesbite if you haven't noticed yet). 
                            The other goals are lowering my body fat percentage enough to obtain abs and learning Mandarin if you care to know. Anyways, as someone with zero coding experience,
                            I am proud to say that I built this from scratch. I would like to thank the countless amount of YouTube coding tutorials and Marvin's Room for helping
                            me through the tough times. There is definitely a huge room for improvement for the site. There are a lot of things that I want to implement to the site, so your eyes peeled for that. 
                            In the meantime, this website will be used as a portfolio for my photography and I'll be keeping a blog on the side for those who want to keep up with my mundane life. 
                            Stay safe out there and don't forget to wear a mask, or else natural selection will come for you. Cheers.
